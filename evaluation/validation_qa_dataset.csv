ID,Question,Ground Truth Answer
1,What are the key issues with the x-ray bone fracture detection dataset?,"1) Most of the images are healthy without fracture, 2) In validation set this is opposite, most of the images are with fracture, 3) Enriched by offline augmentation so the number of original images are much smaller, 4) The box sizes tend to be tiny, and the val/test fractures are even smaller than the training fractures."
2,What are the issues with the annotations in the bone fracture detection dataset?,"The box sizes tend to be tiny, and the val/test fractures are even smaller than the training fractures. Fractures are annotated with bounding boxes, often covering only a few percent of the image."
3,What was the impcat of training larger networks on the bone fracture detection dataset?,"Larger networks did not really help. Their mAP@50 bounced around by a point or two, while the strict mAP@50 to 95 never moved."
4,What is the bottleneck for Yolo on bone fracture detcteion dataset?,The bottleneck is spatial resolution and center point assignment
5,What should I consider when training yolo on an x-ray bone fracture dataset?,"1) Check your dataset splits first, 2) Size matters. Small objects require higher resolution, 3) Loss weights help, but they won’t save you if the detector can’t physically resolve the object, 4) Medical images ≠ street photos. Expect data hunger, imbalance, and tiny targets."
